The blocksworld generators use the random bw state generator provided
by John Slaney and Sylvie Thiebaux. This is contained in the 

bwstates.1

subdirectory. Go there and make. Then go to 

2pddl

and make there, too - this produces an executable that translates the
generator's output to PDDL. The random instances can then be generated
by running (one directory below GENERATOR, in the current
implementation) the script

blocksworld <num>

which takes as input the number of blocks in the problem to be
generated. This is currently maximal 200 due to the random state
generator. To increase that, edit the Makefile in bwstates.1 and
increase SIZE.
